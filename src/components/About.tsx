        <strong className="text-gray-900">Latvala Farms</strong> officially
        registered as Latvalan Maatila Oy, is a family-owned farm located in
        SeinÃ¤joki, Southern Ostrobothnia, Finland. Established in 2005, the farm
        combines crop cultivation and livestock farming, operating as a
        traditional mixed farm with modern practices. Latvala Farms specializes
        in pig farming, and over the years, the operation has expanded through
        strategic investments. In 2004, the farm launched Sikako Oy to focus on
        growing pigs for meat production. Later, in 2016, they established
        LatvaPork Oy, acquiring a piggery in Koskenkorva to further strengthen
        their operations.
